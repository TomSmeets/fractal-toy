# Some design decisions

## Web support
* it runs everywhere
* no need to download or thrust anything

## Not using Imgui
* Imgui is nice, however the rust bindings are not nice to use
* No double support
* It uses an old imgui version
* Custom ui is way cooler

## Compilation time
* no more top level generics
* less generics overall
* acutally prifile compile time
