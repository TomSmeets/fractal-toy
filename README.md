Fractal Toy
===========

This is a fractal explorer made with simplicity in mind.


# Building

For now only the 'sdl' target works correctly.

```
    cargo run --bin sdl
```

# Controls

## Keyboard
* `W` `A` `S` and `D` for movement
* `I` and `K` for zooming
* `J` and `L` change the number of iterations
* `N` cycle fractal types 

The following are mostly for debugging

* `1` toggle tile generation
* `2` toggle debug overlay
* `5` save state 
* `6` load state
